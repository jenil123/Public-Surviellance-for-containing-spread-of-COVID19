# Public-Surviellance-for-containing-spread-of-COVID-19

This project is focused to contain spread of COVID-19.
In this project there are 2 modules that I am working on
1. Social Distancing monitor:
In this module I made a model using YOLOV3 and OpenCV to monitor social distancing both in videos and real-time.
Here I have also shown Bird's eye view of given frame in order to get a better view of the distance between humans in video.
2. Spit Detection:
Here I am supposed to make a model that will detect whether a person is spitting or not.
For this I am preparing the dataset and will update the work done by me.
